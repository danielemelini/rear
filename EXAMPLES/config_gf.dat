! ##### Disc load parameters
!
 917.0                      ! Ice density (kg/m^3)
 0.02537d0                  ! Half-amplitude of the load (deg)
 1                          ! Uncompensated (0) or compensated (1) load
!
!
!
! #### 1D Grid (two options available)
!
! Grid type (1-->Uniform, 2-->Stepsize increases
 1
!
! Minimum and maximum colatitude
!
 0.   60.
!
! Grid stepsize and number of points.
! For gridtype #1, only the (constant) stepsize is used.
! For gridtype #2, stepsize is the minimum spacing.
! *Negative steps are interpreted as alpha/(-step)*
